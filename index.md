This page is dedicated to the collaborative development and sharing of tools, data, and strategies for creating advanced AI for Pokémon battling. This problem require strategic decision-making in an environment with incomplete information. Team-building is a separate but related problem, offering a separate set of puzzles to solve.

# Tools for AI Development

-  [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/): An online Pokémon battle simulator that is widely used for both human and AI battles.

-  [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/): A RESTful API that provides access to an extensive database of Pokémon-related data.

-  [`poke-env`](https://github.com/hsahovic/poke-env): A Python library designed to enable simple and efficient Pokémon AI development. It interfaces with Pokémon Showdown and allows for easy creation and training of AI models.

# AI Battle Bots

-  [showdown](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown): A battle bot for the Pokemon Showdown simulator. It combines heuristics with a minimax search algorithm to make decisions.

-  [`poke-env` simple heuristic baseline](https://github.com/hsahovic/poke-env/blob/22bb424ad05fa963d7a0eb14307572587199d631/src/poke_env/player/baselines.py#L19): A baseline heuristic implemented within the `poke-env` library that demonstrates a simple strategy for Pokémon AI. It can serve as a starting point for more complex algorithms.

# Team Building Resources

-  [Pokemon-showdown's random battles](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/gen-9-random-battle-roles-information-and-code-explanation.3712694/): An insightful thread that discusses the algorithm that drives team selection in Pokémon Showdown's random battles. It's a great resource for understanding how balanced teams are automatically generated, which is a key component in team-building.
